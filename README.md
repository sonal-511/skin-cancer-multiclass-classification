## General Information
- Build custom CNN based architecture to skin cancer from images
- The dataset used contains 9 different categories of images all in RGB 3 channel format
- Model trained on image size of 180*180
- used augemtor library to add more data to training data

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Model tends to overfit without doing any augmentation on data
- The best model obtained has training accuracy of around 87% and validation accuracy of 80%
- the best model is trained in 5392 original and augemented images
